# Student Skill Swap :mortar_board:
**_Cupid for your match made in bartering heaven_**
:gift_heart:

A bartering app that allows college students to exchange skills with each other!

## Purpose: :raised_hands:
To help college kids __get stuff done!__

## Technologies Used: :nut_and_bolt:
**Front End:**

- *HTML, CSS (and Bootstrap), Javascript (and jQuery), TweenMax.to &
Handlebars.*

**Back End:**
-  *NodeJS, Express,  Sequelize, Body-Parser & Method Over-ride*

**Testing:**
- *Mocha, Chai and NightmareJS.*

## The Process:
### 1. BrainStorming: :bulb:
   Our first step was figuring out more about our user and how we wanted to help them out. Most of our content on the website is heavily influenced by our users.

   We also used this time to break down the user's journey and what steps they'd go through to reach their goal of finding someone ready to swap skills!

### 2. The UI :art:
After that, we spent time figuring out how the app would look. From sketches, to Photoshop layouts, we made sure we had a visual flow of our users journey.

*One of our early UI Designs. ^*

Through our development process, we also made sure we had space to allow for more interesting features, and opportunities to make the user's journey simpler and smoother.


### 3. The Development Phase :computer:
 Once we had our vision, we got down to coding! This phase was where spent most of our time, figuring out the nit-bits of:
 1. Adding user authentication
 2. Creating an efficient matching logic
 3. Making sure our routing led our user to the right places
 4. Ensuring our **CRUD** operations were all in order.
 5. Fixing Bugs

### 4. Deployment: :rocket:
And finally, we made sure our Full Stack App was up and ready for the world to see:
