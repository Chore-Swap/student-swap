# Student Skill Swap

A bartering app that allows college students to exchange skills with each other!

## Purpose:
To help college kids __get stuff done!__

## The Process:
### 1. BrainStorming:
   Our first step was figuring out more about our user and how we wanted to help them out. Most of our content on the website is heavily influenced by our users.

   We also used this time to break down the user's journey and what steps they'd go through to reach their goal of finding someone ready to swap skills!

### 2. The UI
After that, we spent time figuring out how the app would look. From sketches, to Photoshop layouts, we made sure we had a visual flow of our users journey.

### 3. The Development Phase
 Once we had our vision, we got down to coding! This phase was where spent most of our time, figuring out the nit-bits of adding user authentication, creating an efficent matching logic, and making sure our routing led our user to the right places.
